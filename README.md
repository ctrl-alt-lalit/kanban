## Using Kanban

Kanban automatically creates a kanban board for each workspace you use. To view this board, click the ```Kanban``` button on the status bar or enter ```Kanban: View``` in the Command Pallete ```(ctrl+shift+P)```.

## Extension Settings

 - `kanban.statusButton.alignment`: Show ```Kanban``` on the left or right side of your status bar. Or don't show it at all.
 - `kanban.statusButton.priority`: Where the ```Kanban``` button should be in relation to other status bar items. A higher number means further left.
