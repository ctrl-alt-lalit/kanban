# Wishlist

Below is a list of features or fixes I would like to add to this extension at some point in the future. If you've got an idea or implementation for a feature to add, feel free to message me or submit a pull request.

* Add ability to perform all operations on the board with a keyboard (accessibility)
  * Currently you can save `(ctrl+S)` and undo `(ctrl+Z)`
* Update icon colors immediately when color theme is changed
* Update settings immediately, rather than on next startup
* Periodically scan comments for *TODO*s and *FIXME*s and add them to a corresponding column on the board
* Undo more than deletions
